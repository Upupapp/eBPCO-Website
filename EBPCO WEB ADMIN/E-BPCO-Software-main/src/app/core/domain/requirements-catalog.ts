// Per-application-type requirement definitions — the single source every
// surface (the intake form's dynamic checklist, the Documents tab, the
// Evaluation view, the Workflow view, the Forms library) reads instead of
// each one inventing its own document list. Exactly one entry per value
// in `ALL_PERMIT_TYPES` (permit.model.ts) — no extra entries, no
// alternate names for the same type.
//
// SOURCE / VERIFICATION NOTICE: every entry's `sources` array records
// exactly where its content came from — see the `SRC_*` constants below
// for the real citations (title, URL, jurisdiction, effective date,
// verification status) gathered via live research on 2026-08-20. Two
// kinds of source appear:
//   - NATIONAL_LAW_VERIFIED: a national statute/IRR fetched and quoted
//     directly (PD 1096, RA 9514) — applies to every Philippine LGU,
//     Castilla included, as a legal baseline.
//   - SAMPLE_REFERENCE_ONLY: another LGU's own published document (Office
//     of the City Building Official, Puerto Princesa) used ONLY as a
//     structural example of how a Unified Application/checklist is laid
//     out — never presented as Castilla's own requirement.
//   - PENDING_CASTILLA_VERIFICATION: the Municipality of Castilla's own
//     Citizen's Charter/OBO checklist was not accessible during this
//     research pass (castillasorsogon.gov.ph blocked automated fetches);
//     every entry below carries this source so the gap is explicit rather
//     than silently assumed away.
//   - CASTILLA_OFFICIAL_FORM_VERIFIED: the actual official Municipality of
//     Castilla (or its local BFP Castilla Fire Station) application form
//     was obtained directly — bundled under public/assets/permits/ and
//     reviewed in full — so its `url` points to that bundled copy rather
//     than an external https link. This is the strongest verification
//     level short of a written confirmation from the office itself.
// `verified` stays `false` on every entry until Castilla's own office
// confirms it, OR the entry is built directly from an actual Castilla/BFP
// Castilla form obtained and reviewed in full (see CASTILLA_OFFICIAL_FORM_VERIFIED
// above) — do not flip it without one of those two conditions.
